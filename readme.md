This is the source code for my [website](http://joshreisner.com), in case anyone's interested in replicating any of 
the features. It uses [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) and [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) 
and gets data from the following APIs with varying degrees of success:

* Facebook
* FourSquare
* GoodReads
* Instagram
* Instapaper
* LastFm
* Readability
* SoundCloud
* Twitter
* Vimeo
* YouTube

All the site's models are provided by [Avalon](https://github.com/joshreisner/avalon), a CMS I'm working on.
